# Geospatial-Blood-Type-Analysis
Visualizing global blood type distribution using geospatial tools.
Project Overview
The project focused on visualizing the global distribution of blood types using geospatial tools. It aimed to uncover geographical patterns and correlations of blood type frequencies worldwide, leveraging spatial data analysis to provide insights.

Key Steps Taken:
Data Collection: Demographic and health-related datasets were gathered to obtain blood type distributions across various regions.

Geospatial Analysis: Using tools like GeoPandas and Folium, the data was mapped to highlight regional differences in blood type prevalence.

Visualization: Interactive maps were created using Plotly and Folium, allowing dynamic exploration of blood type distribution across countries.

Analysis: Statistical and geospatial methods were used to analyze trends, such as clustering of certain blood types in specific geographic areas, and comparisons of distribution across continents.

Insights: The visualization provided a clear understanding of how blood type frequencies vary by region, offering potential insights for public health planning and transfusion services.

Tools Used:
Python Libraries: GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Folium, Plotly

Visualization Tools: Interactive maps, heatmaps, choropleth maps

Analysis Techniques: Spatial clustering, trend analysis

Conclusions:
The analysis revealed significant geographic variation in blood type distribution, with some regions showing dominant blood types while others had more balanced distributions. These findings are important for understanding the accessibility of blood supplies in different regions.
